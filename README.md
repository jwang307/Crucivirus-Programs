# Crucivirus-Programs
A collection of programs used to help annotate cruciviruses, a family of circular ssDNA viruses with characteristics of RNA and DNA viruses. Part of ongoing NSF sponsered research at the Extreme Virus Lab, Portland State University. Focusing on the origin of viruses through the unique viral RNA/DNA characteristics of cruciviruses.

# Programs
Most of the programs are simply annotation scripts meant to help make manual work more efficient. 

# Legit
AutoAnnotate and HMMERAnnotator are two projects meant to provide support for hits detected by HMMER (Hidden Markov Model Biosequence analysis: [hmmer.org](http://hmmer.org)) for automatic annotation in Geneious sequences. <br />
IntronFinder is an upcoming project hoping to discover potential introns and splice sites in cruciviruses.
