This package contains an algorithm designed to read ORFs (Open Reading Frames) of a given metagenomic sample. The algorithm parses for Crucivirus DNA samples looks for Open Reading frames of a length greater than a specified minORFLength. Each ORF is characterized by a starting position, ending position, length, and whether it is from a reverse complement strand or not. See individual functions for their descriptions.
